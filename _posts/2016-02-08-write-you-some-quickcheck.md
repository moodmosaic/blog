title: Write you some QuickCheck
---

In the next couple of posts, I'm going to implement a basic version of QuickCheck from scratch. Follow along and you'll:

 * learn how [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) works
 * become better at using it[^1]
 * see a bit of [Quviq's QuickCheck in Erlang](http://quviq.com/documentation/eqc/index.html) as well

I'll be porting tons of Haskell code in F#[^2]. â€” Disclaimer: I've [done](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2011/11/19/notes-from-porting-java-code-to-net/) [similar](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2011/11/24/fare-finite-automata-regex-in-net/) [things](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2015/09/25/regex-constrained-strings-with-fscheck/) in the past. It's fun!
