title  : RegularExpressionAttribute support in AutoFixture
---

Starting with AutoFixture version 2.6, when this attribute is applied on a data
field AutoFixture will try to generate a value that matches the specified
regular expression.

Let's take as an example the following type:

``` csharp
public class RegularExpressionValidatedType
{
    // Allow up to 40 uppercase and lowercase.
    [RegularExpression("^[a-zA-Z''-'\s]{1,40}$")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [RegularExpression("^http\://[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(/\S*)?$")]
    public string Url { get; set; }
}

```

Prior to AutoFixture version 2.6, AutoFixture by *default* would generate an
instance of the above type with it's properties containing GUID values.

From now on, AutoFixture can handle requests with regular expressions through the
RegularExpressionAttribute class.

## Under the hood

<p>The idea behind this new feature is that members of a <a title="In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means for &quot;matching&quot; (specifying and recognizing) strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">Regular Expression</a>&nbsp;(regex) can be generated by first transforming the regex into a <a title="A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (plural: automata), or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model used to design computer programs and digital logic circuits." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine" target="_blank">finite-state machine</a>, particularly a&nbsp;<a title="In the theory of computation and automata theory, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)—also known as deterministic finite state machine—is a finite state machine accepting finite strings of symbols." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automata" target="_blank">DFA</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also watch a short,&nbsp;introductory,&nbsp;video on the subject <a title="Symbolic Regular Expression Exploration" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Peli/Margus-Veanes-Rex-Symbolic-Regular-Expression-Exploration/" target="_blank">here</a>. (Although it is for <a title="Rex is a tool that explores .NET regexes and generates members efficiently." href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/rex/" target="_blank">Rex</a>, I find it very descriptive.)</p>
<p>The current implementation uses internally the algorithms provided by the&nbsp;<a title="A DFA/NFA (finite-state automata) implementation with Unicode alphabet (UTF16) and support for the standard regular expression operations (concatenation, union, Kleene star) and a number of non-standard ones (intersection, complement, etc.)" href="http://www.brics.dk/automaton/" target="_blank">dk.brics.automaton</a>&nbsp;and <a title="A library for generating random text from regular expressions." href="http://code.google.com/p/xeger/" target="_blank">Xeger</a>&nbsp;packages.</p>

## Using without AutoFixture

This feature is also available stand-alone via the
[Fare library](https://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2011/11/24/fare-finite-automata-regex-in-net/).
