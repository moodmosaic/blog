Pandora enables property-based testing and headless-fuzzing for smart contracts that run on the Stacks 2.x layer-1 blockchain, and allows you to write tests in Clarity.

Clarity is the language for writing smart contracts that run on the Stacks 2.x layer-1 blockchain that connects to Bitcoin for security and enables decentralized apps and predictable smart contracts.

## Why
Having the option to write tests in Clarity helps you minimize context switching, so you can focus on what matters.

However, Pandora is also backwards compatible and can run tests written in TypeScript and JavaScript, as long as they're using Hiro's Clarinet.

The property-based testing and headless-fuzzing capabilities are enabled in both scenarios, so you can benefit from them in both your existing Hiro's Clarinet tests and your (new) Clarity tests.

## Articles

If you are building on the Stacks 2.x layer-1 blockchain and you are trying to find ways to improve your testing structure, you may benefit from the upcoming article series:

## Prerequisites

Node.js and Deno is required for managing Clarity contracts and running tests. Basic knowledge of Clarity, and property-based testing, is assumed. Feel free to contact me if you need help with those.

## Feedback
The ideas presented in the Pandora article series have their origins in a variety of well established testing tools:

QuickCheck, Hedgehog, AutoFixture, Hypothesis, fast-check, all from the perspective of my open-source contributions to those, through the past decade, and by actually using those tools at work.

However, don't consider that as an indication that I'm always right. I welcome feedback on any article.

## About the name
>Pandora was the first human woman in Greek mythology, created by the gods for the express purpose of punishing mortals. The gods entrusted Pandora with a jar containing all the evils of the cosmos for her to unleash upon mankind.
