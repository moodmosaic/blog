>Pandora was the first human woman in Greek mythology, created by the gods for the express purpose of punishing mortals. The gods entrusted Pandora with a jar containing all the evils of the cosmos for her to unleash upon mankind.

Pandora allows you to test your smart contracts in both Clarity and TypeScript. It also enables property-based testing and headless fuzzing your smart contracts.

Clarity is the language for writing smart contracts that run on the Stacks 2.x layer-1 blockchain that connects to Bitcoin for security and enables decentralized apps and predictable smart contracts.

Clarity features a _LISP-like_ syntax. Being able to write tests in Clarity helps you minimize context switching, so you can focus on what matters.

If you are building on the Stacks 2.x layer-1 blockchain and you are trying to find ways to improve your testing structure, you may benefit from the upcoming series of blog posts:

* Pandora - Part 1
* Pandora - Part 2
* Pandora - Part 3
* Pandora - Part 4
* Pandora - Part 5
* Pandora - Part 6
* Pandora - Part 7

Node.js and Deno is required for managing Clarity contracts and running tests. Basic knowledge of Clarity, and property-based testing, is assumed. Feel free to contact me if you need help with those.

The techniques presented throughout the series are inspired from QuickCheck, Erlang QuickCheck, Hedgehog, AutoFixture, Hypothesis, fast-check, a decade of experience contributing to some of those projects, and a decade of experience actually using some of those at work.
